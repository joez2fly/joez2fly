# Hello, I'm Joe Zhang! 👋
## 🌱 About Me:
I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for harnessing the power of data to drive innovative solutions and impactful decision-making. With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building and deploying machine learning models, conducting robust data analysis, and visualizing complex datasets to generate actionable insights. My expertise spans the use of SQL, Python, TensorFlow, and Power BI, and I have successfully deployed models on platforms like IBM Cloud and AWS. Whether it's predicting FX volatility or enhancing product design through data-driven strategies, my goal remains consistent: to leverage data in addressing real-world challenges.

🔭 Leading data science initiatives focusing on predicting the FX volatility.

🌐 Contributed to diverse machine learning domains, from basic linear regression to advanced neural networks.

💡 Passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful stories that influence strategic decisions.

📈 Consistently pushing the boundaries in data analytics, ensuring precision, scalability, and efficiency in every project I undertake.

## 🚀 Projects:
### [Foreign Exchange (FX) volatility Prediction](https://github.com/joez2fly/FX_Volatility_Predection) 
This project is to develop a model to correctly predict the Foreign Exchange (FX) volatility for a Canadian Bank's Capital Market FX trading group. The model's insights enable informed resource allocation and market expansion decisions, minimizing risks and capitalizing on opportunities for the Bank. Best Model boosts over 40% compared to baseline model, results a 0.010403 RMSE and 0.01757 RMSPE 
### [Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption Challenge](https://github.com/joez2fly/Fraud_Detection)  •  [Zindi Competition Site](https://zindi.africa/competitions/fraud-detection-in-electricity-and-gas-consumption-challenge)
This project is to use the client's billing history to identify those involved in these fraudulent activities, aiming to boost the company's revenues and curtail such losses.The best ensembled model showed AUC score of 0.895 and Ranked #8 individual 
### [Vaccination Sentiment Analysis via Twitter](https://github.com/joez2fly/Vaccine_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis)  •  [Zindi Competition Site](https://zindi.africa/competitions/to-vaccinate-or-not-to-vaccinate)
The projec is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.Ranked #19 individual with RMSE of 0.45533
### [Flower recognition model](https://github.com/joez2fly/Flower_recognition)
In the constantly evolving field of computer vision, the ability to accurately recognize and classify images remains paramount. This project aimed to develop an effective image recognition model to identify and classify various flower species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Final model with accuracy of 94.74%
